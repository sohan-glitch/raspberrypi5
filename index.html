  <h2 class="text-animate">Raspberry Pi 5</h2>
  <p>
    The Raspberry Pi 5 represents a major technological step forward in the line of Raspberry Pi single-board computers.
    It is designed not only for hobbyists and educators but also for developers who want compact computing power.
    Built on the Broadcom BCM2712 chipset, it blends efficiency with real performance gains, making it capable of handling
    heavier workloads such as desktop computing, light media editing, and AI experimentation.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section" id="hardware">
  <h2 class="text-animate">Hardware Architecture</h2>
  <p>
    The Pi 5 is powered by a quad-core ARM Cortex-A76 processor clocked at 2.4 GHz. This CPU introduces out-of-order execution,
    larger cache, and better thermal efficiency compared to the Cortex-A72 in the Pi 4. The new VideoCore VII GPU supports
    dual 4K 60 Hz displays, high-efficiency video decoding, and greater throughput for graphics-intensive applications.
    The board layout has been refined for heat dispersion and easy integration of accessories like NVMe drives and camera modules.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section" id="memory">
  <h2 class="text-animate">Memory and Storage</h2>
  <p>
    Two memory configurations are available — 4 GB and 8 GB of LPDDR4X RAM.
    This faster, low-voltage memory ensures smoother multitasking and higher data bandwidth.
    For storage, Raspberry Pi 5 finally supports NVMe SSDs through its PCIe 2.0 x1 interface,
    allowing boot speeds and read/write performance that dwarf traditional microSD cards.
    Nevertheless, microSD remains supported for backward compatibility and quick OS testing.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section" id="connectivity">
  <h2 class="text-animate">Connectivity</h2>
  <p>
    Connectivity has been one of the biggest upgrades in the Raspberry Pi 5. It provides dual micro-HDMI 2.0 ports,
    four USB ports (two 3.0 and two 2.0), Gigabit Ethernet through the RP1 I/O chip, and dual-band Wi-Fi 5 with Bluetooth 5.0.
    A flexible PCIe FPC connector expands the potential for high-speed peripherals such as SSDs and external accelerators.
    The classic 40-pin GPIO header remains fully backward compatible, making hardware prototyping effortless.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section" id="software">
  <h2 class="text-animate">Operating System and Software</h2>
  <p>
    Raspberry Pi OS (Bookworm, 64-bit) is the official operating system optimized for the hardware.
    It delivers a lightweight desktop experience built on Debian 12 and integrates developer tools such as Python, C/C++, and Rust.
    Other Linux distributions like Ubuntu Server, Manjaro, and Kali Linux are supported out of the box.
    The Pi’s open-source ecosystem ensures a steady flow of updates, security patches, and community-driven software enhancements.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section" id="performance">
  <h2 class="text-animate">Performance</h2>
  <p>
    Benchmark tests show a CPU performance gain of nearly three times compared with the Pi 4.
    Everyday desktop tasks, including web browsing, document editing, and IDE usage, are now smooth and responsive.
    The Pi 5 also handles lightweight video rendering and AI inference workloads without significant throttling
    when paired with the official active cooler. It provides genuine desktop-like responsiveness within the power envelope of 15 W.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section" id="build">
  <h2 class="text-animate">Build and Design</h2>
  <p>
    Maintaining its familiar 85 × 56 mm footprint, the Pi 5 adds a power button and RTC (real-time clock) header for better usability.
    Its component layout enhances airflow and cable management, while the new power-management IC provides stable voltage
    under heavy USB or GPU loads. The board feels more refined, built for long-term embedded deployments and desktop enclosures alike.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section" id="power">
  <h2 class="text-animate">Power and Cooling</h2>
  <p>
    The new power design requires a USB-C 5 V / 5 A adapter to unleash full potential.
    The board supports active and passive cooling; the official cooling kit ensures sustained frequencies during intensive sessions.
    Idle temperatures hover around 40 °C, rising to 65 °C under full load, well below throttling thresholds.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section" id="ai">
  <h2 class="text-animate">Artificial Intelligence and IoT</h2>
  <p>
    The Pi 5’s upgraded architecture improves on-device AI tasks using TensorFlow Lite or PyTorch Mobile.
    Its GPIO, I²C, and SPI interfaces let it interact with sensors, cameras, and robotics platforms.
    Coupled with frameworks like Node-RED and Home Assistant, it becomes an intelligent hub for home automation,
    computer vision, and machine learning at the edge.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section" id="network">
  <h2 class="text-animate">Networking and Internet</h2>
  <p>
    Networking performance benefits from the dedicated RP1 I/O controller.
    Gigabit Ethernet now achieves near-line-rate speeds, while Wi-Fi 5 supports faster, more reliable connections.
    For local networking, mDNS allows hostname discovery, and SSH or VNC provide secure remote access without configuration hassles.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section" id="multimedia">
  <h2 class="text-animate">Multimedia Capabilities</h2>
  <p>
    Thanks to the new GPU, the Pi 5 handles dual 4K 60 Hz displays, hardware-decoded HEVC and H.264 streams,
    and HDR content playback with low power draw.
    It can run media-center software such as Kodi or Plex smoothly, making it an ideal compact home-theater core.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section" id="usecases">
  <h2 class="text-animate">Use Cases</h2>
  <p>
    Raspberry Pi 5 can serve as a personal cloud, a lightweight development workstation, a gaming emulator,
    or the control unit of a robotics platform. In education, it introduces students to real hardware computing,
    while in industry, it powers automation, kiosks, and sensor nodes with robust reliability.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section" id="pricing">
  <h2 class="text-animate">Pricing and Availability</h2>
  <p>
    Priced around $60 (4 GB) and $80 (8 GB), the Raspberry Pi 5 remains remarkably affordable given its performance uplift.
    Additional accessories—active cooler, NVMe base, case, and camera—add versatility without inflating costs significantly.
    Units are widely available through official Raspberry Pi partners worldwide.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section" id="conclusion">
  <h2 class="text-animate">Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    The Raspberry Pi 5 bridges the gap between hobbyist computing and serious embedded design.
    Its power efficiency, scalability, and open-source spirit continue to inspire a new generation of creators.
    In short, it’s not just a board — it’s a full computer that fits in your palm and invites limitless experimentation.
